# Calibrated Peer Review

A highly scalable web application that assists the process of coordinating and evaluating peer reviews of student work.

## Running the Project

This web application is made to be built on bare metal Linux environment using Docker. This guide will assume that [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) are already installed on your machine.

**Step 1:** Clone the repository.

**Step 2:** At the root of the directory, create a `.env` file using `.env.example` as the template and fill out the variables.

**Step 3:** Run `sh build-app.sh` to build and start the Docker containers.

On the very first run of the web application, initialize the specified login credentials in your `.env` file for the databases as following:
1. `docker exec -it <database container> bash`
2. Execute the content from `mongo-init.sh`

The web application should be running on the specified domain in your `.env` file.

## Local Development Environment

For local development environment, a Docker setup is not necessary. This guide assumes you already have [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/windows-prerequisites.html) 3.8.4 or higher and [JDK 17](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/17/) or higher installed. For Windows users:

**Step 1:** Install [MongoDB for Windows](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/#install-mongodb-community-edition) (or Mac and Linux counterparts respectively if you are using one). Optionally, install [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass) for a database manager GUI (which also include a built-in terminal), or [mongosh](https://docs.mongodb.com/mongodb-shell/) to execute shell commands without a GUI.

**Step 2:** On Windows, hit `Windows + R`, enter `sysdm.cpl` and navigate to `Advanced -> Environment Variables...` and add the following variables:
- `MONGO_HOSTNAME`: `localhost`
- `MONGO_PORT`: `27017`
- `MONGO_DATABASE`: `cpr`
- `MONGO_USERNAME`: `<your choice>`
- `MONGO_PASSWORD`: `<your choice>`

On Linux-based operating systems, you may achieve the similar result by executing `EXPORT <NAME>=<VALUE>`. 

**Step 3:** Using the MongoDB shell (either using MongoDB shell from terminal or the built-in one in MongoDB Compass) to create authentication for the database by running the following command:

- `db.createUser({user: "<your username>", pwd: "<your password>", roles: [{role: "readWrite", db: "cpr"}]});`

**Step 4:** Run `mvn liberty:dev` to start the project in developer mode. The web app should be running on http://localhost:13126 (the port depends on which microservice you are running).
