# ENGINE BRANCH

Hello team Engine! This will be your branch for the semester. Please contribute your work here so you may work alongside your colleagues in a clean and organized fashion. Additionally, be sure to follow good Github habits, such as:

- Writing clear and concise commit messages describing your changes/updates
- Pushing your work at the end of EACH WORK DAY and labeling "Work in Progress (WIP)" if necessary
- Only sending pull requests to the main branch if you are confident in your clean, stable, and error free work

If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, feel free to reach out to Team Quality/Security in our class discord server. Additionally, if you have any suggestions on how we can improve your Github experience, let us know there as well.
