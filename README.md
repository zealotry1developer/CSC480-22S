A Tool to Facilitate Calibrated Peer Reviews

This branch will be used to house the most stable, reliable code/work items contributed from each of our subteams. Please do not create a pull request to this branch from your own branch until you are confident that your work is reliable and error free. Additionally, before your pull request to main is approved, team Quality/Security will observe and test your work to make sure it is satisfactory. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to us in our discord text channel on our CSC:480 class server.
