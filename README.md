# QUALITY/SECURITY BRANCH

NOTE TO ALL SUBTEAMS: Please do NOT send pull requests to this branch. Send your pull requests to main, and team Q/S will handle the requests that way.

Hello team Quality/Security! This will be your branch for the semester. Please contribute your work here so you may work alongside your colleagues in a clean and organized fashion. Additionally, be sure to follow good Github habits, such as:

- Writing clear and concise commit messages describing your changes/updates
- Pushing your work at the end of EACH WORK DAY and labeling "Work in Progress (WIP)" if necessary
- Only sending pull requests to the main branch if you are confident in your clean, stable, and error free work
